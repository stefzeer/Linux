The first host-only adapter will already have an ipv4 IP address assigned. 
The one that doesn't have it is the NAT adapter which has to be configured : 

cd /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/
copy the file of the configured adapter while renaming it with the second adapter as shown by ifconfig.
edit the newly created file as follows : 

Update the DEVICE and NAME field with the name of the adapter.
Update (or remove) the HWADDR entry
Remove the UUID entry (if it is there)
Make any other changes you need.

Run systemctl restart NetworkManager
check with ifconfig the newly created device and the assigned IP address.
